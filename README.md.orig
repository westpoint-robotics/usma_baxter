Introduction
============

Baxter Pick and Learn is a proof of concept for an application where an operator teach a sorting task to Baxter. It uses a shape recognition algorithm to identify similar shapes and place them to a location previously demonstrated by the operator.
It was developped for a MA1 project at the VUB/ULB in collaboration with Sirris. As the objective of the project was not to develop a reliable implementation but research the possibilities offered by Baxter, this is only meant as a proof of concept and still needs a lot of improvements.

See its [Baxter wiki page](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_Pick_And_Learn) for more information.

Installation
============

There are two versions in this repository, one which works for the Baxter SDK 0.7 to 1.1.1 tagged v1.1 and one for Baxter SDK 1.2 tagged v1.2.

Baxter SDK 0.7 - 1.1.1
----------------------

``` bash
$ cd ~/ros_ws/src
$ git clone 'https://github.com/haxelion/baxter_pickandlearn.git' --branch v1.1
$ cd ~/ros_ws
$ catkin_make
$ rosrun baxter_pickandlearn pickandlearn
```

Baxter SDK 1.2
--------------

``` bash
$ cd ~/ros_ws/src
$ git clone 'https://github.com/haxelion/baxter_pickandlearn.git' --branch v1.2
$ cd ~/ros_ws
$ catkin_make
$ rosrun baxter_pickandlearn pickandlearn
```

Bugs

Feel free to report them as an issue but please note that I don't have access to aBaxter robot anymore and that fixing them might be hard and require your help.

### Instructions on how to setup a workstation and bringup the EECS Baxter robot

#### 1. Follow instructions on [Rethink Robotics wiki](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup) until Step 6

#### 2. After Step 6, perform the following before proceeding to Step 7.
1. Connect Baxter to your workstation using a CAT5 cable and set up a new wired connection as follows:
 - Click on 'Edit Connections' in the networking menu and edit the active wired connection.
 - Name the connection 'baxter'
 - Under the 'General' tab, uncheck 'Automatically connect to this network when it is available'.
 - Under the 'IPv4 Settings' tab, select 'Manual' for Method instead of 'DHCP'. 
 - Under the 'IPv4 Settings' tab, add IP address 169.254.11.xx, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
 - Save and close Network Connections.
 
2. Edit the hosts file and add baxter's IP address with its serial number(which is the hostname).
 - `gksu gedit /etc/hosts`
 - `169.254.11.86 <tab> 011504P0022`
 
#### 3. You may now proceed to [Step 7](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup) to verify your environment setup.

#### 4. And then onto [communicating with Baxter](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Hello_Baxter).


#### For instructions on running the 'Pick and Learn' demo, click [here](https://github.com/westpoint-robotics/usma_baxter/blob/master/pickAndLearn.md).

### Some useful commands:
1. If the sonar sensors are on when Baxter startsup you can turn them off with:  
`rostopic pub /robot/sonar/head_sonar/set_sonars_enabled std_msgs/UInt16 0`

2. To tuck Baxter's arm for storage:
  * Enable Baxter if not already enabled:  
  `rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e`
  * Send the command to tuck arms:  
   `rosrun baxter_tools tuck_arms.py -t`
  * To untuck the arms:  
  `rosrun baxter_tools tuck_arms.py -u`
  * To disable Baxter:   
   `rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -d`
